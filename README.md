## Hi there 👋

I'm Fikri, a software engineer with a passion for front-end development.
I enjoy making apps that improve my daily life, and hopefully help others too. This GitHub is where I share my personal projects, experiments, and ideas as I grow as a developer. I'm currently open to front-end developer roles or any opportunity to learn and contribute, so feel free to reach out! 🤝

Outside of coding, I'm into photography 📷 and video games 🎮. Both give me space to unwind and spark creativity from a different perspective.
